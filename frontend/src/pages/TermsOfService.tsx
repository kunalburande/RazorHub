        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Use License</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-secondary">
          Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on RazorHub's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Marketplace Rules</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-secondary">
          RazorHub acts as a marketplace connecting buyers with local sellers. While we strive to ensure the quality and authenticity of all listed items, RazorHub is not the direct seller of most items on the platform. Sellers are responsible for the accuracy of their product listings, and buyers agree to review items upon delivery.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Limitations</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-secondary">
          In no event shall RazorHub or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on RazorHub's website, even if RazorHub or a RazorHub authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. Revisions and Errata</h2>
        <p className="mb-6 text-secondary">
          The materials appearing on RazorHub's website could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. RazorHub does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete or current. RazorHub may make changes to the materials contained on its website at any time without notice.
